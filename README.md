# SysOverview Widgets

A Rainmeter skin to monitor PC system resources usage.

Actually very poorly written, maybe I'll update when I have some time.

Meters:

- CPU: load, fan RPM, temp.
- RAM: load, clock, SWAP usage.
- GPU: load, fan RPM, temp.
- VRAM: junction temp.
- NETWORK: download and upload.
- DRIVES: usage + real time usage & also uptime in the bottom right.

Requirements:

- Rainmeter 4.3.1+
- HWiNFO 6.42+, make sure Shared Memory Support & Auto Start are enabled.
- HWiNFO plugin



Usage:

Use the included HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer.exe to get sensors for your system and edit \@Resources\Setting.inc to your preferences.
